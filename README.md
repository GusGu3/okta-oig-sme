The OIG SME Github repository serves as a centralized resource for workflows related to customer demonstrations and trial tenants. This platform hosts a variety of pre-configured scripts, integrations, and workflow templates specifically designed to showcase the capabilities of Okta Identity Governance (OIG) solutions. It is intended for subject matter experts (SMEs) who require ready-to-use, customizable materials for effective customer engagement and presentations.

The Github repository also serves as a collaborative space where SMEs can contribute their own workflows, share best practices, and update existing content with the latest features and advancements in OIG. This ongoing collaboration ensures that the repository remains a valuable and up-to-date resource for all Okta partners and representatives engaged in customer demonstrations and trials.

ALL WORKFLOWS IN THIS REPOSITORY ARE MADE BY UPLOADED BY INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTORS AND MUST BE TESTED IN A NON-PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT PRIOR TO PRODUCTION USE.
